# Esum_Data_Visualisation
The programme provides basic data visualisation taken from external sources, like CSV files with captured number values. Each value is translated into visual representation using Processing shapes. The programme uses external libraries for the visualisation, i.e. Plethora Library, Unfolding Map library and Control5P for GUI.
In this visualization, 21 participants are wlking through a street in Zurich, and their represtational strees feeling related environment conditions are displayed. 
This is amazing way to visulaize and spot identification of the environmental influence on the preception of the participants. 
Each participant data was processed using Leadalab, Pnadas, and other signal processing tools.
