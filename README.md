# Esum_Data_Visualisation
The program provides basic data visualization taken from external sources, like CSV files with captured number values. Each value is translated into the visual representation using Processing shapes. The program uses external libraries for the visualization, i.e. Plethora Library, Unfolding Map Library and Control5P for GUI. 

In this visualization, 21 participants are walking through a street in Zurich, and their representational stress feeling related to environment conditions are displayed. This is an amazing way to visualize and spot identification of the environmental influence on the perception of the participants. Each participant's data were processed using Ledlab, Pandas, and other signal processing tools.
